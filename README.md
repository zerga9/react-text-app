### React practice

* Create an input field (in App component) with a change listener which outputs the length of the entered text below it (e.g. in a paragraph)
* Create a new component (=> ValidationComponent) which receives the text length as a prop
* Inside the ValidationComponent, either output "Text too short" or "Text long enough" depending on the text length (e.g. take 5 as a minimum lenght)
* Create another component (=> CharComponent) and style it as an inline box
* Render a list of CharComponents where each CharComponent receives a different letter of the entered text (in the initial input field) as a prop
* When you click on a CharComponent, it should be removed from the entered text
